# RTS Project

## Very simple RTS-like project which involves the use of AI using FSM and Behaviour Trees.

### Because of lack of LFS space, I have included a Unity Package file you need to add to the project to avoid having any issues.

### Brief Description

You only have one goal, collect as many gold as you can with the help of your villagers! You will only need to buy more explorers or miners (if you have enough) and your people will do the rest!


### Simple Tutorial

1. To create more explorers or miners you need to click on the buttons located at the top of the hq.

2. Explorers will search for any UN-MARKED mines. Once they find one, they will place a flag on them so the miners can actually see the mine and start collecting gold.

3. Miners will search for any MARKED mines so they can start collecting gold. Once the mine is empty or they gold capacity is at max, they will go back to the HQ.
